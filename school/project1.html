    <p>
        Once there were trees on a hill in the woods. They were discussing their
        hopes and dreams when the first tree said, "Someday I hope to be a treasure
        chest. I could be filled with gold, silver and precious gems. I could be 
        decorated with intricate craving and everyone would see the beauty. "
